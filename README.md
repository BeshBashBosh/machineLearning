# README
To be made into a **proper** *readme* file

Also testing some git markdown ([good resource here!](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))

## To do
- [x] Fill some temp stuff in here!
- [] What this repo is
- [] What package depencies
- [] How to run/install
*note: these tasklists are a git markdown specific feature. Pretty cool!*

> All good codes come with **great** README's!

```python
readmeStatus = False
if readmeStatus == True:
    print(About time too!)
else:
    print(WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?)
    # ...probably writing...
```
